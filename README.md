A filler text generator built with [Ratpack](http://ratpack-framework.org/).

Append a number to the URL to get that many paragraphs of text (the default is 4). You can also use an *Accept* header to get `text/plain` or `application/json` data instead of HTML.

Pull requests with additional text welcome! The text is currently in the `IpsumGenerator` class but I will move it to a resource file at some point.
